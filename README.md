## **Data Overview**  

### **Source**  
- [CMS Healthcare Provider Data](https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/dataset/9n3s-kdb3#data-table)  

The dataset tracks **readmission rates** across healthcare facilities in different states, providing insights into healthcare equity and hospital-level performance.

## **Dataset Contains**  
1. **Hospital-Level Information**  
   - Metrics on readmission rates.  

2. **Healthcare Equity Data**  
   - Indicators of equity in care delivery.  

3. **Condition-Specific Metrics**  
   - Data on the following conditions:  
     - **PN** (Pneumonia)  
     - **HF** (Heart Failure)  
     - **MI** (Myocardial Infarction)  
     - **COPD** (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease)  
     - **HKR** (Hip/Knee Replacement)  
     - **CABG** (Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting)

## **Key Variables in the Dataset**  
- **Facility ID**: The unique identifier for each facility or hospital.  
- **State**: The U.S. state where the facility is located.  
- **Measure Name**: The specific medical condition or procedure being measured (e.g., Heart failure, hip replacement). The dataset includes six unique conditions.  
- **Predicted Readmission Rate**: The hospital-specific likelihood of patient readmission.  
- **Expected Readmission Rate**: The national average readmission rate for comparison.  
- **Excess Readmission Ratio**: The ratio comparing predicted (per hospital) to expected (national average) rates of readmission.  
- **Number of Readmissions**: The actual observed number of patients readmitted.  
- **Start and End Date**: The date range of the data collection period.
